# Copy-Move Detection and Block Duplication Detection

This repository contains several MATLAB scripts for detecting copy-move manipulation in images. It identifies duplicated blocks or key points within images, which are useful for digital forensics and image tampering detection. The repository utilizes various image processing techniques such as block-wise comparison, feature extraction, and key point matching.

## Files in the Repository

- **.gitattributes**: Git attributes configuration file for handling line endings and other file-specific settings.
- **Copy_Move_Detection_Blocks.m**: A script for detecting duplicated blocks in an image by dividing it into smaller blocks, comparing their histograms, and marking duplicated areas.
- **Copy_Move_Detection_KeyPoints.m**: A script that detects duplicated regions using SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features) keypoints and feature matching to identify tampered regions.
- **Copy_Move_Detection_KeyPoints.asv**: Autosave file generated by MATLAB while editing `Copy_Move_Detection_KeyPoints.m` (this file is not needed for execution).
- **Run_Copy_Move_Detection.m**: A script that loads an image, applies the copy-move detection function (either block detection or keypoint detection), and displays the result.
- **imposing_block_in_image.m**: A utility script that demonstrates how to impose a block into an image at a specific location, useful for visualization and testing the block detection process.

## Description of Scripts

### **Copy_Move_Detection_Blocks.m**

This function detects duplicated blocks in an image using the following steps:
1. The image is divided into smaller, non-overlapping blocks.
2. Histograms for each block are computed and compared using a threshold based on the Euclidean distance.
3. Duplicated blocks are identified, and the corresponding region is marked with a predefined block pattern.
4. The modified image with highlighted duplicated areas is displayed.

### **Copy_Move_Detection_KeyPoints.m**

This function detects duplicated regions by matching keypoints:
1. The image is converted to grayscale.
2. SURF keypoints are detected, and features are extracted.
3. Feature matching is performed to find similar regions in the image.
4. The matched keypoints are marked on the image to highlight the duplicated areas.
5. The result is visualized with the keypoints overlaid on the image.

### **Run_Copy_Move_Detection.m**

This script facilitates the detection process:
1. The user selects an image through a file dialog.
2. The script applies either the `Copy_Move_Detection_Blocks` or `Copy_Move_Detection_KeyPoints` function based on the user's selection.
3. The modified image with the detected duplicated regions is displayed.

### **imposing_block_in_image.m**

This utility script is used to visualize how a block can be imposed on an image. It demonstrates how to insert a block at a specified location and visualize the effect of block duplication.

## Requirements

- MATLAB with Image Processing Toolbox.
- The scripts are designed to process `.tif` images.

## How to Use

1. Run the `Run_Copy_Move_Detection.m` script.
2. Select an image from the file dialog.
3. The script will automatically apply the copy-move detection algorithm to the image and display the result.

### Example of Block Imposition

You can run `imposing_block_in_image.m` to visualize block imposition. This script inserts a block at a specified position in the image and then displays the modified image.
